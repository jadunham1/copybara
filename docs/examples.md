## Basic git-to-git import

This example will import Copybara source code to an internal git repository
under ``$GIT/third_party/copybara``.

Assuming you have an existing git repository. For the example in ``/tmp/foo``. But it could be
a remote one:

```bash
mkdir /tmp/foo
cd /tmp/foo
git init --bare .
```

Create a ``copy.bara.sky`` config file like:

```python
url = "https://github.com/google/copybara.git"

core.workflow(
    name = "default",
    origin = git.origin(
        url = url,
        ref = "master",
    ),
    destination = git.destination(
        url = "file:///tmp/foo",
        fetch = "master",
        push = "master",
    ),
    # Copy everything but don't remove a README_INTERNAL.txt file if it exists.
    destination_files = glob(["third_party/copybara/**"], exclude = ["README_INTERNAL.txt"]),

    authoring = authoring.pass_thru("Default email <default@default.com>"),
    transformations = [
	    core.move("", "third_party/copybara"),
	],
)
```

Invoke the tool like:

```bash
copybara copy.bara.sky --force
```

``--force`` should only be needed for empty destination repositories or non-existent
branches in the destination. After the first import, it should be always invoked as:

```
copybara copy.bara.sky
```

## Transformations

Let's say that we realized that we need to do some code transformations to the imported code.
We could use core.replace to do it. Here we look for ``//third_party/bazel/bashunit`` text
and we replace it with the correct destination one just for BUILD files:


```python
url = "https://github.com/google/copybara.git"

core.workflow(
    name = "default",
    origin = git.origin(
        url = url,
        ref = "master",
    ),
    destination = git.destination(
        url = "file:///tmp/foo",
        fetch = "master",
        push = "master",
    ),

    # Copy everything but don't remove a README_INTERNAL.txt file if it exists.
    destination_files = glob(["third_party/copybara/**"], exclude = ["README_INTERNAL.txt"]),

    authoring = authoring.pass_thru("Default email <default@default.com>"),
	transformations = [
   	    core.replace(
        	before = "//third_party/bazel/bashunit",
	        after = "//another/path:bashunit",
        	paths = glob(["**/BUILD"]),
		),
        core.move("", "third_party/copybara")
    ],
)
```

### Subcommands

The tool accepts different subcommands, _Ã  la_ Bazel. If no
command is specified, *migrate* is executed by default. These two commands are
equivalent:

```shell
$ copybara copy.bara.sky
$ copybara migrate copy.bara.sky
```

You can validate your configuration running:

```shell
$ copybara validate copy.bara.sky
Copybara source mover
INFO: Configuration validated.
```

And you can get information about a migration workflow by running:

```shell
$ copybara info copy.bara.sky
Copybara source mover
...
INFO: Workflow 'default': last_migrated_ref 4dd20b2...
```
